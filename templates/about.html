        Welcome to our tool. 
        Keep in mind, this tool only works on .idf files that come straight out of the Ewat drawing tool.
        The following assumptions are made:
        <ul>
            <li>Busbar thickness and string thickness are 0.3 mm and 1 mm respectively.</li>
            <li>Insulation thickness is 2 mm in height.</li>
